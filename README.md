Go语言核心知识点梳理，帮助和我一样从C++、Java转Go，并且使用Go作为主语言备战秋招的小白快速学习Go语言基础知识（重点是和其他语言的差异部分），从基础到web开发项目、gin等框架的应用，从0到1024，最终夯实基础，拿到心仪的大厂offer！

Golang core knowledge points comb, help someone like me from C++, Java to Go, and use Go as the main language to prepare for the autumn recruitment (focus on the differences with other languages), from the basics to web development projects, gin and other applications of the framework, from 0 to 1024, and finally solid foundation, get a dream offer!

As a result of the previous study of 408 professional basics, after deciding to study abroad IELTS and other English results study time basically replaced the coding time, so for Java syntax, Java internships and projects, SSM framework, SVM and other basic knowledge has been slightly forgotten. 

I have been very optimistic about the natural high concurrency of the go language and the fact that more and more big factories are using go to refactor their code and write new projects with go, and the go framework is also in the development stage, so many wheels need to be built by themselves, and many of my classmates around me have been interviewed in Java and then switched to go. I will start from scratch to familiarize myself with the language syntax, gin framework, etc. and use go to brush up on LeetCode, complete the project of mit 6.824 distributed system, etc. I will give up my previous internship and project in Java and challenge a new language!
